Learn basic c commands
The first line "#include<stdio.h>" that is used to include required library . stdio stands for standard input output .By writng this line we can use printf and scanf statements 
next line "int main(){}" It is where we write our main program . int is variable name .
next is "//" or "*/" is used to write commands in our program . By writng commands we are making easiy to understand and reusable .
next is "printf()" By using this statement we can print anything .
There are many variable datatypes , They are 
                        *Integer(int) eg:15 , 2999 , 0998 ,etc
                        *Decimal (float) 6 to 7 decimal points   eg:1.3 , 4.888 ,etc
                        *decimal(double) 15 decimal points   eg:2.77777777 , 8.9765489 ,etc
                        *character(char) eg; a,b,A,etc
next is "int a=15;"  In this line we are storing an integer value in a variable named "a" . By using we can access that variables easily in fututre       
next is "printf("%d int value",a);" %d is a type specifier here it specify integer value . The things inside " " will print .
next is "return 0;" it is used to return a value that is 0.
